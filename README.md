# Group-Command
!group in chat to show the group link

Hello everyone, I know it's a simple plugin but I'm quite proud because I did it from scratch.
Basically this plugin allows a player to do! Group in the chat and a message with the link of your group appears.
(The command and message can be changed to whatever they want.)

Installation - 
The .smx file must be placed in [addons\sourcemod\plugins]. And the .sp in [addons\sourcemod\scripting].

Configuration - 
The editing file is "groupcommand.sp" and is located in [addons\sourcemod\scripting\groupcommand.sp].

If you need help you can add me in steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/crafa/

Hope you like it :)
